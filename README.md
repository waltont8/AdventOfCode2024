Advent of Code 2024

## --- Day 1: Historian Hysteria ---
That felt quite fiddly for day 1. Working on columns, having to do lookups against sparse data, multiple spaces between the input numbers "41226   69190
" - all things that make it a bit tricky. Unless you're going to cheat, which anyone doing 9 seconds for parts 1 surely is. How much of the leaderboard is ml?

Day 1 code is  [here](AoC/src/Day01.hs)
